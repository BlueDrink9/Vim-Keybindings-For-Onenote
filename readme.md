VIM Key bindings for One Note
====
*This projet is a lab in [OneNoteLabs](https://github.com/idvorkin/OneNoteLabs/wiki)*

This project brings the power of VIM to the organizing power of Onenote. 

To use this project, you must have [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed. 

To use, the script, launch AutoHotKey passing vim_onenote as the script name.

```
C:\gits\Vim-Keybindings-For-Onenote>\bin_drop\AutoHotkey.exe vim_onenote.ahk
```

Implemented Bindings

Below are some of the key bindings implemented (if this table is stale, feel free to update it)

| Keys | Name|
|:------|:----|
|ESC | Enter normal mode (makes VIM key bindings active)|
| hjik | Motion Commands|
|C^F/C^B|Page Up/Page Down|
|0/$|Start Of Line/End Of Line|

Quirks
-----
There are lots of quirks because AutoHotKey doesn't know the current cursor location, and OneNote behaves differently based on the cursor location. I'll list some of the bigger ones here
* Fold only works in list mode.
